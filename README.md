### 🐤 Hello!
I'm Anami, a 20-something game developer from Perú currently working on starting as an indie dev, and I'm ocasionaly alive.

I graduated from Game Design, work as a game programmer, enjoy writing, and am co-founder of FemDevs Perú, a peruvian asociation of female game developers.
I love dating sims, farming sims, horror stories, manga and, most importantly, Terry Pratchett.

Work mostly on Unity and Godot, though I like to learn about different tools and engines.

Fluent in Spanish, less fluent in english.

> Black lives matter. Stop asian hate. Trans rights are human rights. Free Palestine. Ni una menos.
