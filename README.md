### 🐤 Hello!
I'm Anami, an almost-30 game developer from Perú currently working on kickstarting a small indie studio with some friends, and I'm ocasionaly alive.

I graduated from Game Design, work as a game programmer, enjoy writing, and am co-founder of FemDevs Perú, a peruvian asociation of female game developers.
I love dating sims, farming sims, horror stories, manga and, most importantly, Terry Pratchett.

Work mostly on Unity and Godot, though I like to learn about different tools and engines.

I speak Spanish, and I can speak English, C#, JS and HTML.
